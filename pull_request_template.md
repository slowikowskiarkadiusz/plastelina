CAUTION:
- ALWAYS run 'generate.ps1' before making a PR and before pushing new changes to the branch. If there're going to be any problems because of your changes then you'll be the first to notice them.
- DO NOT modify anything in the folders /Code and /Schema/Result by hand. All of the changes over there have to be done automatically by the script 'generate.ps1'.
- All of your changes probably should be done only in /Schema/Models folder and the contents of /Code and /Schema/Result should be amended automatically by 'generate.ps1' script.
